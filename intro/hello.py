#I guess everything has to start somewhere
print("Hello world")

#in python the indentation is a fundamental part of the language
if(3<5):
    print("3 is smaller than 5")
#it doesn't matter the amount of lines you use for the indentation as long as is the exact same on all the block of code

#this code will not work because of the indentation and it will be marked as "sintax error"
#if(3>5)
#print("3 is not greater than 5")
